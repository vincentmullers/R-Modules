Hey Skyler,

Glad you made it to the third module. 

We've now got some real data to play with!
Unfortunately, data is never really as clean as you'd hope it to be. We need to clean it up a bit before we can unleash upon it any model.

I've done part of the work for you in the tutorial. You'll be working on the final bits in the practice.R file. 

Thank you!
